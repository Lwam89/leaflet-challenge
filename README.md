# The instructions for this activity are broken into two parts:

Get dataset from "https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_month.geojson"
Create a map to plots all the earthquakes based on their longitude and latitude;
Create circle markers to reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by colour.
Create a legend that will provide context for map data.


# Leaflet-Part-2: Gather and Plot More Data (Optional with no extra points earning)

Get tectonic dataset from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/master/GeoJSON/PB2002_plates.json"
Get earthquake dataset from "https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_month.geojson"
Create base maps with Street Map & Topographic Map
Create overlay map with Tectonic Plates and Earthquakes.
The earthquake map with circle markers to reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by colour.
Create a legend that will provide context for map data.
